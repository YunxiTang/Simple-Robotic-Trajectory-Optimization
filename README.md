# Motion-Planning
## Motion Planning/ Trajectory Optimization for Dynamical System

### Classical Differential Dynamic Programming
Implement the classical indirect (single shooitng) DDP/SLQ algorithm.

### Multiple Shooting Differential Dynamic Programming (MS-DDP)
Extend the classical indirect (single shooitng) DDP/SLQ algorithm to multiple shooting framework. 

### Constrained Multiple Shooting Differential Dynamic Programming (CMS-DDP)
  #### (1). Add nonlinear state constraints and control constraints (box constraints) on MS-DDP
  #### (2). Augmented Lagrange method for constrained optimal control problem.
  #### (2). An relaxed log barrier method is required to polish the solution from AL-CMS-DDP
### MPC Framework
